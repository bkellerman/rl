A small script that finds the solution to the cracker barrel peg game / triangle game.

Instructions along with one of the game's solution can be found here:
http://www.joenord.com/puzzles/peggame/

The solution is determined by building a game tree and using a depth-first search algorithm.
Game Tree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_tree
Depth First Search: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search

The slot's are numbered 0 - 14 in sequential order (Top to Bottom, Left to Right)
    /0\
   /1 2\
  /3 4 5\
  etc etc
